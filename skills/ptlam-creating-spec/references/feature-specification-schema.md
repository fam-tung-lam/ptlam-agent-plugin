# Feature specification schema

This reference owns the feature-spec file shape, status transitions, and the
standard for ticket-planning readiness. Read it before writing or revising the
spec.

## File shape

Use every heading. Write `None` with a reason when a section does not apply.

```markdown
# Feature specification: <feature>

- Status: <draft | blocked | ready>
- Updated: <timestamp>
- Source scope: <PRD path and heading, or durable feature brief>
- Glossary: <path, or unavailable>

## At a glance

<One literal paragraph that lets the reader reconstruct the feature's purpose
and observable result.>

## Visual overview

<At least one earned Mermaid diagram or scan-friendly table that replaces the
equivalent prose.>

## Feature contract

<Who can do what, under which preconditions, and what observable result
follows.>

## Scope boundaries

### Included

<Behavior this feature owns.>

### Excluded

<Adjacent behavior this feature deliberately leaves out.>

## Behavior

### <B-01: descriptive behavior>

- Given: <observable starting state>
- When: <actor or system action>
- Then: <observable result>
- Failure: <rejection, recovery, or None with reason>
- Evidence required: <what must be proven, without test mechanics>

## Permissions and policy

<Authorization, policy, privacy, and compliance constraints.>

## Data and lifecycle

<Owned data, invariants, state transitions, retention, and deletion behavior.>

## Interfaces and compatibility

<Inputs, outputs, contracts, compatibility, and deliberate implementation
freedom.>

## Failure and recovery

<Validation, error visibility, retry, idempotency, concurrency, and degraded
behavior.>

## Operations and rollout

<Signals, migration, rollout, rollback, and support constraints.>

## Architecture constraints

### <A-01: structure expensive to reverse>

- Accepted structure: <the confirmed judgment and the boundary it fixes>
- Trade-offs: <what the structure gives up and why that is acceptable now>
- Deferred: <concern left out and the signal that adds it, or None>
- Redesign trigger: <the measured number, curve, or named event>
- Source: <architecture judgment, ADR, or confirmed statement>

## Assumptions and risks

<Assumptions with evidence, plus risks and their consequences.>

## Blocking decisions

<Decision, owner, consequence, and return path to decision work, or None.>

## Traceability

<Map each behavior ID to its source heading and affected contract or constraint.>
```

Use stable behavior and structure IDs within the file. Preserve an existing ID
when revising its wording. Retire an invalidated behavior explicitly instead of
silently reusing its ID for another contract.

## Status rules

| Status    | Meaning                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `draft`   | The feature contract is being synthesized and has not been checked. |
| `blocked` | An outcome-changing decision is missing or contradictory.           |
| `ready`   | Every readiness check passes and ticket planning may begin.         |

Move directly from `draft` to `blocked` or `ready` after verification. A
revision of a ready spec returns to `draft` until its affected sections pass
again.

An architecture recommendation the user has not confirmed is a blocking
decision: record it under Blocking decisions and set status `blocked`.

## Readiness checks

| Check        | The specification must                                                                                               |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source       | Name one confirmed scope source and cite a source heading for every behavior.                                        |
| Explanation  | Make unfamiliar content reconstructable without changing source facts.                                               |
| Visual       | Include one earned visual form that replaces equivalent prose.                                                       |
| Boundary     | Separate included behavior, exclusions, and deliberate implementation freedom.                                       |
| Vocabulary   | Use glossary terms when available and contain no material term conflict.                                             |
| Behavior     | State observable success, validation, failure, and recovery behavior.                                                |
| Data         | Account for ownership, lifecycle, privacy, retention, and deletion.                                                  |
| Contracts    | State interface and compatibility promises without accidental design choices.                                        |
| Operations   | Account for signals, migration, rollout, rollback, and support impact.                                               |
| Architecture | Record each structure expensive to reverse with its trade-offs, deferred concerns and signals, and redesign trigger. |
| Proof        | Name evidence required for each behavior without prescribing test mechanics.                                         |
| Decisions    | Carry no unresolved outcome-changing decision.                                                                       |
| Traceability | Map each behavior ID back to its source and affected contract.                                                       |

Finish with status `blocked` when any check fails because evidence or a decision
is missing. Finish with status `ready` only when all checks pass.
