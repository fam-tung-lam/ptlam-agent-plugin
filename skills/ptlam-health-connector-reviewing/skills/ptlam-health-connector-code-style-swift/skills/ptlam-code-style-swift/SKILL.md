  Write, review, and fix Swift library and application code against conventions

  toolchain, documentation comments, and tests. Use when starting or
  standardizing a Swift package, changing Swift code or its lint and format
  configuration, reviewing Swift-specific design, or resolving a swift build,
  SwiftLint, or SwiftFormat failure. Use as the foundation for Swift platform
  and project specializations. Do not use for Objective-C.

# PTLam Swift Code Style

Rules for Swift library and application code: the package manifest, the
SwiftFormat and SwiftLint toolchain, naming and access control, optionals, type
choice, failure design, structured concurrency, documentation comments, and
tests. This skill owns Swift mechanics only; the foundation owns the standard.

## Required skills

### `ptlam-code-style`

**Reason:** Provides the language-neutral conventions and testing doctrine the Swift mechanics satisfy.

**Instructions:** Read and apply ptlam-code-style first.
Let it own precedence; complexity; source structure and boundaries;
naming and readability; data modeling; contracts; failures;
documentation; logging; the behavior contract; test levels; test
placement; and test doubles.
Use this skill only for Swift language, package, and tool mechanics.
This specialization may be stricter than the foundation, never
looser.

Read [ptlam-code-style](skills/ptlam-code-style/SKILL.md).

## Before the first edit

1. Resolve the package root and read every applicable `AGENTS.md` from the
   repository root down to the files in scope.
2. Read `Package.swift`, `.swift-version`, `.swiftformat`, `.swiftlint.yml`,
   `Package.resolved`, and the CI or workspace scripts. Note the tools version,
   language mode, platform floors, targets, and the real format, lint, build,
   and test commands.
3. Treat the checked-in configuration and the commands CI runs as the truth. An
   installed SwiftLint that no command invokes is not a gate.
4. Apply the stricter rules to code you add or substantially change. Leave
   unrelated legacy inconsistencies alone.

For a new package, use Swift Package Manager, the Swift 6 language mode,
SwiftFormat, SwiftLint, and Swift Testing. In an existing project, keep its
working toolchain until replacing it is part of the task.

## Do the work

1. Keep each changed declaration at the narrowest access level its real
   consumers allow, and mark a class `final` unless something subclasses it.
2. Remove every force-unwrap, force-cast, and implicitly unwrapped optional from
   code you touch; bind with `guard let` instead.
3. Give each changed throwing function a named `Error` type whose cases a caller
   can act on.
4. Keep shared mutable state inside an `actor` or on `@MainActor`, and give
   every type that crosses an isolation boundary a real `Sendable` conformance.
5. Write a `///` comment on every declaration the package publishes.
6. Add or update behavior tests in the package's existing test target.
7. Run the checks narrow to broad, stopping at the first failure:

```shell
swiftformat Sources/Changed.swift
swiftlint lint --strict --quiet Sources/Changed.swift
swift build
swift test --filter ChangedBehavior
swiftformat --lint .
swiftlint lint --strict
swift test
```

`swiftformat` without `--lint`, and `swiftlint --fix`, rewrite files. Read the
diff before continuing: reflowing a declaration moves the line a
`// swiftlint:disable:next` comment applies to.

## Finish

Finish when the package builds under its declared language mode, SwiftFormat
reports no unformatted file, SwiftLint passes under `--strict` with every
remaining suppression carrying its reason, and the affected tests pass under the
project's own commands.
