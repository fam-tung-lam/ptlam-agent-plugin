# Dart Naming and Formatting

The case conventions Dart expects, and what `dart format` decides so nobody
argues about it.

## Case follows the kind of declaration

| Kind                                           | Form                         | Example                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| File, folder, package                          | `lowercase_with_underscores` | `place_order_use_case.dart` |
| Class, enum, extension, mixin, typedef         | `UpperCamelCase`             | `OrdersRepository`          |
| Member, variable, parameter, named constructor | `lowerCamelCase`             | `maxRetryCount`             |
| Constant                                       | `lowerCamelCase`             | `defaultTimeout`            |
| Library-private declaration                    | Leading underscore           | `_OrdersView`               |
| Import prefix                                  | `lowercase_with_underscores` | `as http_client`            |

A Dart constant is `lowerCamelCase`, never `SCREAMING_CAPS`. Privacy is a
leading underscore scoped to the library, not the class.

Name an implementation file after the API it owns, in snake case.
`OrdersRepository` lives in `orders_repository.dart`.

## The formatter owns whitespace

Run it, take its output, and never spend a review comment on it:

```bash
dart format .
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
```

The check form exits `1` when any file would change, which is what CI should
run. `dart format` rewrites files even when the analyzer excludes them, so keep
generated output out of its path.

The formatter reads `page_width` and `trailing_commas` from
`analysis_options.yaml`. Never hand-wrap around it: under the default
`trailing_commas` setting the formatter removes a trailing comma and rejoins the
construct whenever it fits, so a comma added to force a layout is undone on the
next run. Set `trailing_commas: preserve` when the project wants author-chosen
splits to survive.

## Quoting and redundant syntax

- Use single quotes. Switch to double quotes only to avoid escaping an inner
  apostrophe; `prefer_single_quotes` and `avoid_escaping_inner_quotes` enforce
  the pair.
- Omit `new`; it has been optional since Dart 2.
- Omit `const` inside an already-constant context.
- Omit `this.` outside a constructor initializer or a shadowed parameter.
- Use `//` for an explanation and `///` for a doc comment. Reserve `/* */` for
  temporarily disabling code you are about to delete.

## Finish

Finish when every new declaration matches the case for its kind, each file is
named after its owning API, and
`dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .` reports no difference.
