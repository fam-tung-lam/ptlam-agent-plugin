# PTLam Kotlin Code Style

Conventions for Kotlin library and application code: the Gradle build, the
ktlint and detekt gates, module visibility, null safety, data modeling,
functions, failure design, coroutines, KDoc, and JUnit 5 tests. This skill owns
Kotlin language and toolchain mechanics only. The foundation owns the standard
they satisfy, and a platform or repository specialization owns everything above
them.

<!-- PLUGIN-COMPILER:REQUIRED-SKILLS -->

## Before the first edit

1. Resolve the Gradle module that owns the files in scope, then read every
   applicable `AGENTS.md` from the repository root down to those files.
2. Read `settings.gradle*`, the module's `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`,
   the version catalog when one exists, `.editorconfig`, the detekt
   configuration, and the nearest sources under `src/main/kotlin` and
   `src/test/kotlin`.
3. Record the Kotlin version, the `jvmTarget`, the applied plugins, the check
   tasks those plugins register, and the test framework. These are the
   mechanics. A dependency on the classpath does not prove a task runs it.
4. Confirm a task name with `./gradlew tasks` before you quote it in a handoff.
   Task names differ between a plain JVM module and a platform variant module.
5. Apply the rules below to code you add or substantively change. Leave
   unrelated legacy inconsistencies alone.

For a new module, apply the Kotlin Gradle plugin,
`org.jlleitschuh.gradle.ktlint` with a checked-in `.editorconfig`,
`io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt` with a checked-in configuration file, and JUnit 5
with MockK, Kotest assertions, and `kotlinx-coroutines-test`. In an existing
module, keep its working toolchain until replacing it is part of the task.

## Apply the mechanics

1. Give every declaration you add the narrowest visibility its real consumers
   allow, and an explicit return type on anything not `private`.
2. Remove every `!!` from code you touch, and give each value crossing a Java
   boundary an explicit Kotlin type.
3. Keep public properties, parameters, and return types on `val` and read-only
   collection types.
4. Take dispatchers as an injected dependency, and keep every coroutine inside a
   scope something owns.
5. Add or update JUnit 5 tests in the module's existing test home for the
   normal, boundary, and failure cases the change touches.
6. Run the checks narrow to broad: the focused test class, then `ktlintFormat`
   and `ktlintCheck`, then `detekt`, then the module's test task, then the
   module build.

Inspect the diff after `ktlintFormat` or any other write-mode task. Report the
exact commands, their results, the lint exclusions that affect confidence, and
every check you did not run.

## Finish

Finish when the changed code compiles at the module's `jvmTarget`, passes ktlint
and detekt with no new finding and no new baseline entry, exposes no unintended
public surface, leaks no coroutine outside an owned scope, and passes the
affected JUnit 5 tests under the module's own tasks.
